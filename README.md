# Genetic Sequence Analysis Program

Computational complexity = 10n^2 + 4n + 22

Time complexity = O(n^2)

Input: Please type a 16 letter char sequence twice composed of only "g","c","t","a" for the genetic sequence.



# Creating neural network with weights optimisation using 4 adifferent algorithms

While optimising the weights using the 4 algorithms, it was noted that pso algorithm performed the best among all and the standings based on accuracy were:-

1. PSO Algorithm
2. Cultural Algorithm
3. Genetic Algorithm
4. ACO Algorithm

To keep it fair, all the algorithms were given the same epochs, population and I/Os.
